            <h1 id="intro"><small>Opening an online store</small></h1>
            <h2><small>The story of how a talented lady became a successful eCommerce seller</small></h2>
            <p><em><strong>Once upon a time</strong>, in the magnificent land of India, there lived a fair maiden of name Shikha. Shikha was a creative lass who made all sorts of beautiful goods. "Shikha, your hands are pure magic", said her friends, "Why don't you sell your goods online?"</em></p>

            <p><em>Now, while Shikha was extraordinarily talented in many ways, she had no idea how to open a store online. She asked her friends who suggested that she talk to the biggest merchant in the land.</em></p>

            <h2 id="why"><small>The large marketplace</small></h2>
            <p><strong>Snapazonkart</strong> burped after his hearty meal. He had discovered pots of gold in a faraway land and was doing very well indeed. He picked up the ringing phone and heard a small voice on the other end. She wanted to open an online store. <em>"Of course we'll help you, you little seller. Just courier your VAT, TIN, AFGT and JYIGG papers, along with notarised copies of your address proof, your grandmother's birth certificate and neighbour's maiden name. We'll set up a store for you right away."</em></p>

            <p>Shikha thanked the man and felt very sad. How would she get all those papers? It would take a long time and cost a lot of money. All she wanted to do was to open an online store and see how it goes. A friend referred her to another merchant. He's not so pompous and will definitely help you, he assured her.</p>

            <h2><small>The niche marketplace</small></h2>
            <p><strong>Craftsirraw</strong> was eager for sellers. His business was constantly under threat from Snapazonkart. He welcomed Shikha with open arms and helped her set up a store on his site. He promised to advertise on her behalf and handle all monetary transactions. <em>"Just focus on making your awesome goods and selling them"</em>, he said, smiling broadly. <em>"Of course, I'll charge you a commission of 20-40 percent for my services."</em></p> 
            <p>Shikha opened her store and got an initial flurry of orders. Though the commission ate into most of her profits, she was happy that she was at least able to sell online. But soon, orders started drying up. She couldn't do anything because she had no insight into the customers visiting her store. All she could do was cross her fingers and pray. Worse, Craftsirraw was not great at settling her payments, leaving her short of cash.</p>

            <h2><small>The SaaS store</small></h2>
            <p>She then approached <strong>Zeprocketify</strong>, a merchant who helped people open online stores on their own sites. He was glad to have her on board. Since she was just starting out, he suggested that she purchase the starter plan at a nominal cost of a thousand rupees a month. <em>"You can always upgrade once your business grows"</em>, he assured her.</p>

            <p>Boy, Shikha was glad or what! Finally, she had a store that she had complete control over. She signed up with a payment gateway and cut a deal with a courier provider. She was in business for real! It was a tough learning curve, and there were technical glitches, but it was worth it. However, customers were still not buying as much as she would have liked. She did some analysis and realised that she needed to add more products and variants. And more images for the products too.</p>

            <p><em>"For that, you'll have to upgrade to our premium plan"</em>, Zeprocketify informed her sombrely, <em>"and if you use our super premium plan, you'll be able to sell internationally too"</em>. Now, Shikha wasn't keen on risking several thousand rupees every month without knowing if it would work. She was caught in a dilemma.
            </p>

            <hr id="features"/>

            <h2><small>Nirvana</small></h2>
            <p><em><strong>"Woo hoo! Open your online store for free"</strong></em>, she heard a soothsayer outside her door. He told her about this new merchant who was just perfect for sellers like her. WooPlaza was his name. She decided to pay the man a visit.</p>

            <p>His office was sparsely furnished but clean. He wore simple clothes and exuded earnestness. He spoke passionately about millions of potential sellers out there who could be online but aren't. He wanted to make it his life's mission to enable everyone to sell online. <em>"We should make it as easy as possible for people to start selling online. We should build a community of sellers who will support each other and grow together. Sellers should be able to share marketing costs. They should have a way to get into customers' smartphones".</em> He grew increasingly animated as he spoke.</p>

            <p>He was almost rambling, but Shikha was fascinated. His enthusiasm was infectious. She found herself in agreement with almost everything he said. But she had to focus on her own store. <em>"Can I really open and operate my store for free?"</em>. <em><strong>"Yes"</strong></em>. <em>"Without any limitations on number of products, variants or images?"</em> she asked doubtfully. <em><strong>"Yes"</strong></em>, he replied proudly, <em><strong>"no limits whatsoever"</strong></em>. <em>"But what's the catch?"</em> <em><strong>"There's no catch"</strong></em>, he replied with obvious sincerity, <em><strong>"See, we are building the Air Deccan of online selling. We want to make it possible for everyone to sell online. We plan to do that with a no-nonsense, no-frills service."</strong></em>
            </p>

            <h2><small>The questions</small></h2>
            <h3><small>"What are the features you offer?" she asked</small></h3>
            <p>"Let's see," he said, "as he ticked off the features one-by-one on his fingers"</p>

            <hr id="faq"/>

            <h3><small>"Tell me something about the technology"</small></h3>
            <p>Our stores are powered by the WordPress / WooCommerce stack. Wordpress is used on 20% of ALL websites in the world. It is well known for its ease of operation and SEO friendliness. WooCommerce, built on top of WordPress, powers over 600,000 eCommerce sites worldwide. You are in good company.</p>


            <h3><small>"But how can you afford to keep free? And what do you mean by no-frills?"</small></h3>
            <p>"We keep our costs low", he said, "We prefer to spend only on what really helps our customers. You should see our website to see how frugal we are!"</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We don't have a separate sales and marketing team. Our customers are our best marketing agents</li>
              <li>We don't offer phone support. The seller community we are building will be able to support each other much better than anything customer support team."</li>
              <li>We don't offer Google or FB ad credits</li>
              <li>We don't offer free payment gateways. PayUMoney offers a free payment gateway that you can integrate with your site.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><small>"What do you mean by community of sellers?"</small></h3>
            <p>"We are building an online forum where sellers can get support, ask questions and seek tips. You would benefit from the experiences of veteran sellers as well as industry experts. Our team would be actively engaged in the forum, which would also serve as the primary means of customer support."</p>

            <hr id="pricing"/>

            <h3><small>"Is is free forever?"</small></h3>
            <p>"For small sellers, yes. We charge on a per-order basis. The first hundred orders you get on your store every month are not charged. Thereafter, we charge Rs. 10 per order. That way, your costs are aligned to how well your business is doing."</p>

            <h3><small>Trying it out herself</small></h3>
            <p>"Why don't you check out some of our demo stores?" he suggested, "You can access them from the navigation menu. Use a username of 'storeowner' and password 'W00Plaza!' (without quotes)"</p>

            <p>Shikha played around with the backend interface of some of the demo stores. Not only were the storefronts gorgeous, the admin interface was completely intuitive and better than anything else she had used. She was completely sold.</p>

            <h3><small> "When are you launching?"</small></h3>
            <p>We are seeking signups now. Our first batch of sellers will start selling in July. We plan to keep the number of seller under 100 during launch. Once we fine-tune our processes, we will accept morre sign ups a few months down the line.</p>

            <h3><small>Her heart sank. "What criteria would you use for accepting the initial set of sellers?"</small></h3>
            <p>Our intent is to build a community of sellers who will support and help each other grow. To that extent, we will give preference to groups of friends who want to sell online. So, be sure to share this site with your friends and convince them to sign up too!</p>
